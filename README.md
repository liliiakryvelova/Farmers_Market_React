# _Farmer's Market Circuit_

#### _Avery's Organics is a mid-sized farm in Northern Oregon that grows organic produce and sells it at farmers markets throughout town. Since Avery's is at a different market almost every day, they've started a website to show customers which market they will be at on a given day._

_Avery's also grows different crops in different seasons. They'd like to display what produce is available during which months on their site too._

## Technologies Used

* _React_
* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _Javascript_

## Description

_Using React and all other tools we've covered so far, create a website that depicts this information. Take time to construct your entire environment from scratch. It's important to practice these fundamentals before we increase the complexity of our projects later in this course section._
_Try using local state to toggle between different days. Note that we can use conditional rendering for as many conditions as we want â€” including all seven days of the week_
